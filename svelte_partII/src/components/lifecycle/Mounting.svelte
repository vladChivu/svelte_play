<script>
    import { onMount } from 'svelte';

    let photos = [];

    onMount(async () => {
        const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos?_limit=5`);
        photos = await res.json();
    });

    let paragraph = "It's recommended to put the fetch in onMount rather than at the top level of the <script> because of server-side rendering (SSR)."; 
    let paragraphTwo = "With the exception of onDestroy, lifecycle functions do not run during SSR, which means we can avoid fetching data that should be loaded lazily once the component has been mounted in the DOM."; 
</script>

<p>Every component has a lifecycle that starts when it is created, and ends when it is destroyed. 
    There are a handful of functions that allow you to run code at key moments during that lifecycle.
    The one you'll use most frequently is onMount, which runs after the component is first rendered to the DOM. 
    {paragraph}
    {paragraphTwo}
    Lifecycle functions must be called while the component is initialising so that the callback is bound to the component instance 
    â€” not (say) in a setTimeout.
    If the onMount callback returns a function, that function will be called when the component is destroyed.
